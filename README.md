# Portfolio

My portfolio website built with Next.js framework. It uses (headless) DatoCMS for content management and leverages static site generation for rapid loading times and exceptional performance.

Furthermore, it uses Framer Motion in combination with Tailwind CSS to create advanced animations and provide a seamless user experience.
